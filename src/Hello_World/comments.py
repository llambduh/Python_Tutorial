'''
This is a multi-line comment using single quotes
In Python, a string literal that is not assigned to a 
variable or used in an expression is treated as a no-op 
(no operation) by the interpreter. This means it is effectively 
ignored during execution. This behavior is leveraged to 
create multi-line comments.

Multi-line comments are often used to describe a large block 
of code, debug multiple lines of code, 
or Docstrings (more of them later).
